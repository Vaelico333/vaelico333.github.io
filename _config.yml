  I was born in Valladolid, Spain, in 1990. I always had a big interest in learning, especially math and nature studies. I was the quiet kid who can be for hours sitting on a couch, reading a book.

  In 2020, I learned python on [Stackskills](https://stackskills.com/).  
  <br>
  In February 2023, I took on a course called _"Data Science and Machine Learning: Making Data-Driven Decisions"_, imparted by [Great Learning](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/), developed in partnership with the [MIT IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu/) (Institute for Data, Science and Society of the Massachusetts Institute of Technologies)
  <br>
  Right now, I'm studying Data Analytics and Power AI with [thePower](https://app.thepower.education/)
