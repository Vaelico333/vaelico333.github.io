## My story  

I was born in Valladolid, Spain, in 1990. I always had a big interest in learning, especially math and nature studies. I was the quiet kid who can be for hours sitting on a couch, reading a book.  
I always found formal education quite opressive and unfit for me, so despite my interest on the subjects, I only got really successful on the ones I really liked.  
Fast forward a few years, most of my work experience has been as a production assistant or technician. It was an interesting, yet unstable job.  
Then, on **September 2019**, I flew to England to work as a waiter on a hotel's restaurant called Alvaston hall. I stayed there for 2 years, despite the COVID crisis and all, and I learned a great deal of things. On my spare time, while I waited for the hotel to reopen in 2020, I learned python on [Stackskills](https://stackskills.com/). Finally, after another year in the UK, I decided to come back to Spain.  
While I returned to my previous job of production assistant, I took on a course called _"Data Science and Machine Learning: Making Data-Driven Decisions"_, imparted by [Great Learning](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/), developed in partnership with the [MIT IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu/) (Institute for Data, Science and Society of the Massachusetts Institute of Technologies). I learned a lot about data analysis, business recomendations and machine learning.

## Where am I now at

And so, for a year, due to some improvement in my production technician career, I kept a low profile as a developer, but the right time came after I met a very special person, who became my girlfriend shortly after. Now I'm studying Data Analytics and Power AI with [thePower](https://app.thepower.education/), and I'm starting to do some freelance projects: more on that soon.

## My goal & purpose

I aim to become a competent data analyst, data scientist and machine learning specialist, helping companies automate processes, improve their efficiency, collect relevant data and extract insight from it.
